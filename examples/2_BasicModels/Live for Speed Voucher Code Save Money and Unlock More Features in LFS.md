Live for Speed (LFS) is a realistic online racing simulator that lets you race with various cars and tracks. If you want to enjoy the full features of LFS, you need to buy a license that unlocks more content and options. However, if you want to help a friend who cannot buy a license for some reason, or if you want to give someone an LFS license as a gift, you can buy a voucher code instead.

A voucher code is like a gift card that you can use on the LFS website. You can buy a voucher code for any value from Â£3 to Â£36 and give it to someone else. They can then use it to upgrade their license to a higher level, such as S1, S2 or S3, which offer more cars, tracks and features. The price of a license depends on the country of the person who uses the voucher code, so make sure you check the license prices before buying a voucher code.
 
To buy a voucher code, you need to have an LFS account and log in on the LFS website. Then go to the [shop](https://www.lfs.net/shop/voucherselect) and select the type of voucher you want to buy. You can enter any amount from Â£3 to Â£36 and pay with PayPal or credit card. You will receive an email with the voucher code and instructions on how to use it.
 
To use a voucher code, you also need to have an LFS account and log in on the LFS website. Then go to the [register](https://www.lfs.net/register) page and enter your voucher code in the field provided. The amount of the voucher will appear as credit on your account. You can then use that credit to buy or upgrade your license on the [shop](https://www.lfs.net/shop) page.
 
A voucher code is valid for one year from the date of purchase. You can only use it once and it cannot be refunded or exchanged. If you have any questions or problems with your voucher code, you can contact the LFS support team at [support@lfs.net](mailto:support@lfs.net).
  
Live for Speed is not only a racing simulator, but also a racing community. You can join online races with other players from around the world, chat with them on the forums, and join or create your own racing leagues. You can also customize your cars and tracks, download mods and skins, and watch replays and streams of other racers. LFS is constantly updated with new features and improvements, so you will never get bored of racing.
