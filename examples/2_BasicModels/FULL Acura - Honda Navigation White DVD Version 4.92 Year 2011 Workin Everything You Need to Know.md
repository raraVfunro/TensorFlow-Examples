To install the DVD, you need to locate your navigation unit in your vehicle and insert the new disc. The system will automatically detect the new disc and prompt you to update your maps.

The FULL Acura - Honda Navigation White DVD Version 4.92 Year 2011 Workin is a good option for owners who want to keep their navigation system up to date and enjoy the benefits of accurate and reliable maps. However, some users have reported some issues with the DVD, such as compatibility problems, missing streets, outdated information, or errors during installation[^3^]. Therefore, it is advisable to check your vehicle model and system version before purchasing the DVD, and to follow the installation instructions carefully.
  
If you have successfully installed the FULL Acura - Honda Navigation White DVD Version 4.92 Year 2011 Workin, you can start using your updated navigation system right away. You can access the main menu by pressing the NAVI button on your dashboard or steering wheel. From there, you can choose from various options such as entering a destination, viewing the map, adjusting the settings, or accessing the help menu.
 
One of the features of the DVD is the voice recognition function, which allows you to control your navigation system with voice commands. This feature is available for some models and regions, and requires a compatible microphone and speaker. To use voice recognition, you need to press and hold the TALK button on your steering wheel until you hear a beep. Then, you can say one of the commands listed in the voice recognition guide that comes with the DVD. For example, you can say "Find nearest gas station" or "Go home". The system will confirm your command and guide you to your destination.
 
Another feature of the DVD is the split-screen mode, which allows you to view two different types of information on your screen at the same time. For example, you can view the map and the turn-by-turn directions, or the map and the points of interest along your route. To activate the split-screen mode, you need to press the MAP/GUIDE button on your dashboard or steering wheel. Then, you can use the joystick or knob to select the type of information you want to see on each side of the screen.
 
The FULL Acura - Honda Navigation White DVD Version 4.92 Year 2011 Workin is designed to enhance your driving experience and make your trips easier and safer. However, you should always use your judgment and common sense when following the navigation system's instructions. The system may not account for road conditions, traffic situations, detours, or other factors that may affect your route. You should also obey all traffic laws and signs, and pay attention to your surroundings. The navigation system is only a tool to assist you, not a substitute for your own responsibility.
